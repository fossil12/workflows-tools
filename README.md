# My workflows and tools

This is a random notes collection of my workflows and tools. I create them when I learn a new language or I have the urge to write up about workflows I use since years. Be aware! Most is [macOS](http://www.apple.com/macos) related as this is my OS of choice. (Some of them might en up becoming a blogpost when I have a blog again. ðŸ™ƒ)

If you find a typo feel free to open a PR.
